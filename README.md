# Banking Channel Usage Analysis, Customer Segmentation, and Digital Adoption Forecasting
Analyse customer transactional behavior across different banking channels and segment customers to identify digital adopters, branch-dependents, and omni-channel users. 
I will focus on the following questions in this analysis:
- How are customers using different banking channels?
- Which customers are still branch-dependent?
- Who is digital-first and why?
- Are digital channels growing?
- How do we reduce operational costs in banks?
- What will channel usage look like in 3-6 months?

## Business Problem Definition
Banks operate multiple channels such as: branches, ATMs, mobile, and online platforms. Managing these channels efficiently requires understanding customer behavior, channel costs, and future usage trends. This project aims to segment customers based on their channel usage and forecast channel demand to support digital transformation and cost optimization.
